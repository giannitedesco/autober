Autober - an application specific language for generating BER decoders
Copyright (c) 2010 Gianni Tedesco

0. INTRO
--------
autober is a language for generating BER decoders. It's different from an ASN.1
compiler in that it's much simpler and it only deals with BER encoded messages.
It is intended for smartcard and RFID applications where much of the data
stored on these devices is, in-fact, BER encoded TLV data. The language is
designed to be very similar to the template definitions found in the
specifications for smartcard and RFID applications.
